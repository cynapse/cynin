"""
This script tests an id to make sure it is valid.

Returns an error message if the id is bad or None if the id is good. Parameters
are as follows:

    id - the id to check

    required - if False, id can be the empty string

    alternative_id - an alternative value to use for the id if the id is empty
    or autogenerated

Note: The reason the id is included is to handle id error messages for such
objects as files and images that supply an alternative id when an id is
autogenerated. If you say "There is already an item with this name in this folder"
for an image that has the Name field populated with an autogenerated id, it can
cause some confusion, since the real problem is the name of the image file name,
not in the name of the autogenerated id.
