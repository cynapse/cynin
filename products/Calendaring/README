A simple calendar implementation for CMF/Plone.  Which does
all sorts of really cool stuff.  It is made to be modular and
give a great out-of-the-box experience.

FEATURES:

  - Import/Export of iCal events

  - Hooks PUT_Factory so you can put events with DAV/FTP.

    o NOTE: This works very well with Publishing feature
      with OSX's iCal application.

    o calendar_export is subscribable from iCal

  - Reliably exports events for KOrganizer, iCal and Outlook

  - Provide a extensive framework to create your own
    Calendar Views.  Ships with a Month, Week and Day view.

  - There is a proper Calendar object which can store Events.

  - Over 60 unit tests that cover almost all of the functionality
    REQUIRES: ZopeTestCase from http://sf.net/projects/collective

Roberts add ons:

  - allows to define what states are used to mark days in the calendar
    portlet and to be found when clicking on a marked day.

    Install Calendaring by help of the QuickInstaller

    change
        here/portlet_calendar/macros/portlet
    to
        here/portlet_calendaring/macros/portlet

    go to portal_calendar->properties

    add the states you want to be handled like:

        - published

        - private

    Create calendar objects containing events. Change the events to any of the
    appropriate states. You should now get them presented according
    to their state and visibility to you (and not only the published ones).
