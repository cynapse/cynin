Calendar
========

This file describes the nature of the integration of calendar functionality
as exposed by p4a.calendar on the Plone platform.

We start out by building up a folder with some events.

  >>> from DateTime import DateTime
  >>> from datetime import datetime

  >>> id = folder.invokeFactory('Folder', id='calendar-folder')
  >>> calendarfolder = folder['calendar-folder']
  >>> id = calendarfolder.invokeFactory('Event', id='event1')
  >>> calendarfolder['event1'].update(title='First Event',
  ...                                 startDate=DateTime('2006-09-28 08:30am CEST'),
  ...                                 endDate=DateTime('2006-09-28 09:30am CEST'))

Now we go ahead and activate calendaring capabilities on this new
folder.

  >>> from p4a.calendar.interfaces import ICalendarConfig
  >>> config = ICalendarConfig(calendarfolder)
  >>> config.calendar_activated
  False
  >>> config.calendar_activated = True
  >>> config.calendar_activated
  True

Lets check out the default view and make sure we can get some activity.

  >>> view = calendarfolder.unrestrictedTraverse('@@month.html')

We do a query for the weeks and make sure the results have the event
we created earlier.

  >>> view.default_day = daydate=datetime(2006, 9, 1)
  >>> view.firstweekday = 6
  >>> weeks = view.weeks()
  >>> day = weeks[4]['days'][4]
  >>> day.day
  28
  >>> len(day.events)
  1
  >>> event = day.events[0]
  >>> event['title']
  u'First Event'
  
XXX I suspect this test depends on your local timezone. I need to test that:

  >>> event['timespan']
  u'08:30 to 09:30 GMT+2'
