CMFNotification events
======================

Since version 2.0, CMFNotification subscribes to events that are fired
by the different components of Plone.


Item creation
=============

When an item is created through the web, a (long) list of events is
fired. Unfortunately, we cannot easily disambiguate this case from a
simple call to ``invokeFactory()``.

Moreover, ``invokeFactory()`` creates an "empty" item and does not set
any attribute. It does not even set default value. We usually do not
want to notify users that such an item has been created. When we use
``invokeFactory()``, we usually edit it a few lines later. And, when
we are done, we should fire an appropriate event:
``ObjectInitializedEvent`` is a quite good candidate, since it is the
event tha is fired after a normal creation through a browser.

This is why third-party products that uses ``invokeFactory()`` **may
not work** with CMFNotification if they do not fire any event. If they
fire something else than the expected event
``ObjectInitializedEvent``, then a few ZCML lines will do the trick
(see ``events.zcml``, this is quite readable).


Other actions
=============

Other actions use appropriate, unambiguous events. There is nothing
much to say about them.
