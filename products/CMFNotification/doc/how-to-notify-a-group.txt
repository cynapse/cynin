How to notify members of a group
================================

Notifying members of a group is a standard feature of numerous Plone
portals. For example, you might want to notify all members of the
"Reviewers" group when an item is submitted.

To configure CMFNotification, you have to go to the ZMI. Then click on
the ``portal_notification`` object and fill the *Rules on workflow
transition (users)* rule with something like::

    python: transition == 'submit' :: python: context.getGroupMembers('Reviewers')

Fill the *Rules on workflow transition (mail template)* with something
like::

    * :: string:workflow_mail_notification

Save the configuration and add the following script somewhere (e.g. in
``portal_skins/custom``) ``group_id`` parameter::

    from Products.CMFCore.utils import getToolByName

    tool = getToolByName(context, 'portal_groups')
    group = tool.getGroupById(group_id)
    if group is None:
        return ()
    return group.getGroupMembers()

Add a ``group_id`` paramater to the script, and a ``Manager`` proxy
role. (Warning: it lets any user able to list users of a group on your
portal. It is up to you to consider whether this is a security risk.)

You might want to include this script in a product rather than putting
it in ``portal_skins/custom``.
