==========================
Roadmap of CMFNotification
==========================

The feature list is not closed. Future releases may include:

- add a digest mode. In this mode, users would receive e-mail
  notification in a single, regular (daily or weekly) e-mail;

- add a "Manage my subscriptions" page (a variation of the site map),
  which lists the subscriptions of the logged-in user;

- add a "Manage subscriptions" page for portal administrators;

- the ability to disallow security check for each rule. Something
  like:

      * :: here/getReviewers :: python: True

  The third component of the rule would be labeled "trusted". If the
  second component of the rule is trusted, then no security check is
  done;

- a nice configuration form: for now, the configuration is done
  through the automatically generated properties form of the tool,
  which does not appear to be very user-friendly. Note that redoing
  the same form with ``zope.formlib`` is not the point. Ideas,
  sponsors or patches are welcome, since I'm not keen on working on
  that, for now :)

- notification when a discussion item is added;

- notification when a portal member changes its properties ("partially
  implemented" but not yet tested);

- notification when an item is renamed or moved (cut and pasted): for
  now, renaming or moving an item does not send any notification. We
  might want to send one;

- notification when an item is removed: for now, removing an item does
  not send any notification;

- anonymous subscription: this will allow anonymous users to subscribe
  their email address to an item.

If you would like to participate to the development of this product,
feel free to drop me an email so that I can coordinate everybody's
efforts.
