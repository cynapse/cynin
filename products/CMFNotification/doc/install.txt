Installation and configuration of CMFNotification
=================================================

Installation
============

1. Read the `right documentation`_ if you have never installed any
   product.

2. Install the product in the file system (as usual).

3. Install the product in your Plone portal, via the Plone control
   panel (as usual).

Principles and rules
====================

Before frantically clicking everywhere, blindly hoping that this will
"just work", we would better begin by introducing the principles of
CMFNotification and, particularly, the rules::

    This is not 'Nam, there are rules.

    -- Walter Sobchak (The Big Lebowski)

This is a required step. Firstly because if you do not configure
CMFNotification, nothing special will happen. You have to configure
it. Secondly, understanding what you are doing is the first step to
understand why it does not work. This will save your time.

CMFNotification lets you define who will receive e-mails, when and
what mail template will be used. Mail templates can be used to have
specific mails for specific events (when an event is published with a
determined keyword, for example).

To determine who, when and what, you have to define rules. There are
two kinds of rules:

- rules that define who we are sending e-mails to. There is one such
  rule for each supported type of event (item creation, item
  modification, workflow transition, etc.) ;

- rules that define which mail template we will use.


Configuration
=============

To configure CMFNotification, click on the "Configuration of
CMFNotification" configlet in the Plone control panel.

Enabling and disabling features
-------------------------------

Labels should be self-explanatory. However, here is a quick guide to
the configuration form:

*enable extra subscriptions*
  if enabled, users will be able to subscribe or unsubscribe to items
  via the buttons that appear in the "Mail subscription" portlet
  (which is added in the right column, by default). They will
  therefore receive an e-mail notification when an event occurs, if
  the notification of this event is enabled. See *Rules for list of
  users* section in the rules reference for further details. Note that
  this feature is restricted by a permission: *CMFNotification:
  Subscribe/unsubscribe*. By default, this permission is granted to
  ``Manager`` and ``Member`` roles. Note that anonymous subscription
  is not implemented.

  Default: disabled.

*toggle recursive mode for extra subscriptions*
  if enabled, an user who has subscribed to a folder will
  automatically be subscribed to items of this folder (and sub-folders
  and their subitems, etc.)

  Default: enabled.

*toggle debug mode*
  if enabled, CMFNotification will log the addresses that it sends
  e-mails to and the messages themselves. This can be particularly
  helpful when debugging your rules.

  Default: disable.

*rules (ignore)*
  this is a special rule to disallow notification. This can be handy
  when you want to temporarily disable notification in one click
  withoug messing up with the whole configuration. A simple rule like
  this one does the trick::

      python: True

  You could also want not to send any notification for items in a
  specific folder. Using an "ignore rule" is much more handy that
  customizing all rules::

      python: here.isInFooSection()

  Default: the default rule disable notification of temporary items::

      python: getattr(context, 'isTemporary', lambda: False)()


Configuration of the rules
--------------------------

If you are really in a hurry, you may want to look at "How to setup
CMFNotification in two minutes" (``how-to-setup-in-2-minutes.txt``).

If you are not, take your time and read more about rules
(``rules-reference.txt``).


Logging
=======

Every error or potential problem (if no user was found for a
notification, if a problem occurs when trying to find or apply the
mail template, etc.) is logged. If you do not receive any e-mail,
check your Zope log file.

For futher details, see ``how-to-troubleshoot.txt``.
